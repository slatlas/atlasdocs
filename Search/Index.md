# Search

The Search feature provides a powerful global search capability across all major entities in Atlas including customers, leases, locations, areas, batteries, personnel, and more. This allows you to quickly find any record in the system from a single search interface.

## Overview

The search functionality scans across multiple data types simultaneously and returns relevant results organized by entity type. You can search by various attributes including names, codes, addresses, and other identifying information.

## Using Search

1. Navigate to Search from the main menu
2. Enter your search term in the search field
3. Results will be displayed grouped by entity type (Customers, Locations, Leases, etc.)
4. Click on any result to navigate directly to that record's detail page

## Search Tips

* Search terms are matched across multiple fields for each entity type
* Partial matches are supported - you don't need to enter the complete name or code
* Use specific identifiers (like lease codes or location numbers) for more precise results
* Results respect your permission settings - you'll only see records you have access to
