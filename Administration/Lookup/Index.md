# Administration Lookup Tables

Lookup tables provide reference data and configuration options used throughout Atlas. These tables contain the types, categories, statuses, and other classification values that standardize data entry and reporting.

## Overview

Lookup tables are organized by functional area to make them easier to find and manage. Most lookup tables allow you to add, edit, and disable values to match your business terminology and requirements.

## Lookup Categories

## Managing Lookup Tables

Most lookup tables provide similar functionality:
* **Create** - Add new values
* **Edit** - Modify existing values
* **Disable** - Mark values as inactive (preserves history)
* **Reorder** - Change display order
* **Defaults** - Set default selections

## Best Practices

* Use descriptive names that are clear to all users
* Disable values rather than deleting to preserve historical data
* Establish naming conventions for consistency
* Document custom values and their purposes
* Review and clean up unused values periodically
* Consider reporting needs when creating categories
