# Sandbox

After logging into the application for the first time, you can turn on the sandbox mode.
To do this, click on the menu and go to the settings. once there find the button that says 'Turn On Sandbox' and click it.
The dialog will warn you that any data not uploaded is going to be deleted and that the app is going to shut down. 
Go ahead and click YES, to delete the local database and have the app shut down. Now that sandbox is turned on, you will
need to log back into the system. It will be the same password as you production account. Once you are signed in, allow the 
application to complete a full sync and use the application as you normally would, uploading only to the test environment.
