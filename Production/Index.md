Production tracks oil and gas production data from customer locations. This module records production volumes, monitors well performance, and provides production-based analysis and reporting.

**Route:** `/app/main/production/locationProductions`
**Permission:** `Pages.LocationProductions`

## Overview

The Production page manages production data entry and reporting for oil and gas locations. Production volumes are used for analysis, optimizing chemical treatments, and reporting to customers.

## Key Features

* Record production volumes by location and date
* Track oil, gas, and water production
* Monitor production trends over time
* Identify production changes or anomalies
* Calculate water cut and gas-oil ratios
* Correlate production with treatment activities
* Generate production reports and graphs
* Import production data from external systems
* Export production data for analysis

## Production Metrics

* **Oil Production** - Barrels of oil per day
* **Gas Production** - MCF of gas per day
* **Water Production** - Barrels of water per day
* **Water Cut** - Percentage of water in total fluid
* **GOR** - Gas-oil ratio
* **Run Time** - Operating hours
* **Downtime** - Non-producing hours

## Data Entry

Production data can be entered manually through the interface, imported from spreadsheets, or integrated from SCADA systems and production accounting software.

## Analysis

Production data is used to:
* Optimize chemical treatment programs
* Identify well performance issues
* Track treatment effectiveness
* Calculate chemical dosage rates
* Generate customer production reports
